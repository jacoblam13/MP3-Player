Arduino MP3 Player
========

An MP3 player made out of an Arduino that plays any MP3 file you can imagine (I have mine play video game music). It includes an LCD screen that displays song information and a set of buttons that can raise and lower volume, flip between song tracks, flip between albums, and pause or resume.
